                Antarctica has been the only continent not reached by the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.[269]

                A cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases was detected in December 2019 in Wuhan and eventually spread to the rest of China.[270] Afterwards, many other Asian countries started to confirm cases, with some of the most affected countries being South Korea, Malaysia, and Iran. Sophisticated modelling of the outbreak suggests that while the number of cases in China would have been many times higher without interventions such as early detection and isolation of the infected, 66% fewer people would have been infected if China had implemented measures as little as a week earlier.[271] As of 21 March, cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, while North Korea and Yemen have suspected cases. No cases have been reported in the disputed states of Artsakh and South Ossetia.

                A small number of initial cases in Europe were reported in France, Germany and other countries. On 21 February, a large outbreak was reported in Italy, mostly in the north near Milan. Cases grew rapidly as the outbreak spread across Europe. Cases have been reported in all European countries after Montenegro reported a case on 17 March, and in all European territories after the Isle of Man on 19 March, the disputed state of Transnistria on 21 March[272] and Åland Islands on 22 March reported cases. No cases have been reported in Svalbard, Alderney, and Sark. The WHO has declared Europe as the new centre of the virus after the situation improved in China.[273]

                The first cases in North America were reported in the United States in January 2020. Cases were reported in all North American countries after Saint Kitts and Nevis confirmed a case on 25 March, and in all North American territories except Bonaire, Saba, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon (as of 2 April).

                Cases have been confirmed in Australia, Easter Island, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Hawaii, New Caledonia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. The first confirmed case was in Melbourne, Victoria on 25 January.[274] Many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their borders. Cases have been reported in all Oceanian sovereign states except Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, and have not been reported in the associated states of Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Cook Islands, and Niue. Additionally, no cases have been reported in American Samoa, the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, Norfolk Island, Pitcairn Islands, Tokelau, and Wallis and Futuna.

                As of 19 March, cases have been confirmed in all South American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, Venezuela and the French overseas department of French Guiana. Cases were confirmed in all South American territories, as cases were confirmed in the Falkland Islands on 3 April.

                The coronavirus was first reported in South America on 26 February when Brazil confirmed a case in São Paulo. Since then, governments across the region have taken an array of actions to protect their citizens and contain the spread of COVID-19.[275]

                Main article: 2020 coronavirus pandemic on cruise ships
                
                The outbreak spread to several cruise ships including the Diamond Princess, the Grand Princess, the World Dream, the MS Westerdam and the MS Braemar.[276][277][278][279]
                
                Cruise operators have started to either cancel or change their itineraries as countries across the world implement travel restrictions to curb the disease spread. Ports are refusing to accept cruise ships that have been either to Chinese ports or are carrying Chinese passengers during the outbreak.
                
                The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), which represents 90% of cruise operators, announced the various precautionary measures being implemented by its members. All passengers who have travelled to or visited/transited through China, Hong Kong and Macau within 14 days before embarkation will be denied entry into cruise ships. Any persons in close contact with either suspected or diagnosed cases of coronavirus infection will also be denied entry.[280]
